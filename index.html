                    There are many different symptoms of Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD). However, some of the most common include intense fear and anxiety when faced with social situations or interactions. You may experience extreme self-consciousness, a lack of confidence, difficulty forming relationships, and increased heart rate and body temperature. In addition to these typical symptoms, SAD may involve significant sleep and eating problems. Individuals with SAD often struggle to fall asleep or eat due to their anxiety levels skyrocketing whenever they have to go out in public. They may also find it difficult to concentrate on anything other than avoiding the situation.  Suppose you notice any of these signs in yourself or someone you know. In that case, it is essential that you seek help from a professional therapist who can provide treatment explicitly tailored to your condition.
